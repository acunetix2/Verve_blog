# Forensic Imaging — TryHackMe Room 

---

## Task 1: Introduction


In Digital Forensics, imaging is the process of creating an exact, bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media. This process ensures that all the data, including deleted files, hidden files, and unallocated space, is captured. By generating a forensic image, we preserve the original data, allowing for a thorough examination.

The primary goal of this process is to create a verifiable and reliable copy that can be used in investigations and legal proceedings. This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of digital evidence, ensuring that the original data remains untouched and admissible in legal matters. 

Furthermore, the process plays a critical role in maintaining the chain of custody, a crucial aspect of legal proceedings. By documenting the handling and transfer of digital evidence, we can demonstrate that the data has been preserved correctly and has not been tampered with, providing a reliable and transparent method for examining it.

## Task 2: Preparation
The process of imaging a disk starts by identifying the target drive, preparing it for imaging, and then creating the image file which is later verified for integrity. This needs to be performed in an environment that allows us to perform these tasks and also ensures the process is properly logged.

Each operating system has specific file system structures and configurations that require different imaging tools and techniques. In our scenario, we will use Linux as the OS to acquire the data and create a forensic image of a drive. The use of open-source software for image acquisition is an advantage in many cases since it can satisfy guidelines for evidential reliability that need to be fulfilled. The Linux kernel also supports many file systems, which is a big advantage when analyzing different media types.

Start the attached machine in this task by clicking the Start Machine button. A split-screen view of the VM will appear. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can access the machine via SSH using the following credentials below.

```bash
THM Key Credentials
Username	analyst
Password	forensics
IP	MACHINE_IP
```
# Write-Blockers

It is important to mention that write-blockers are usually required when manipulating physical disks. A write-blocker is a device used to prevent any modifications to data on a storage device during analysis. It ensures reading data without risking changes to the original evidence.

Write-blockers work by physically intercepting all drive commands that write data sent between the disk being imaged and the OS attached to it.

Audit Trail 

An audit trail is a chronological record that tracks actions and events within a system, providing a detailed history for accountability and security. It ensures traceability by documenting each step. This step can be performed with different parameters depending on the legal or compliance framework required by the task.

We can manually or automatically record the actions and events with varying detail levels. Since we need to preserve the evidence and keep track of our activities, let's explore some methods for tracking tasks and automating command-line activity logging to help us have this audit trail of our process.

If we are using bash, the history command can help us log our activity. It can be saved using a timestamp and preserved in a file. Below, we can observe a chart with some commands recommended to use during our session.

set -o history - Enables command history in the shell, allowing it to record the commands you enter.
shopt -s histappend - Ensures that the command history is appended to the history file instead of overwriting it when the shell exits.
export HISTCONTROL= -Clears any settings that control which commands are saved in the history, ensuring all commands are recorded.
export HISTIGNORE= - Clears any settings that ignore specific patterns of commands, so all commands are saved in the history.
export HISTFILE=~/.bash_history - Sets the file where the command history is saved.
export HISTFILESIZE=-1 - Sets no limit on the number of lines stored in the history file.
export HISTSIZE=-1 - Sets no limit on the number of commands retained in the shell history.
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F-%R " - Formats timestamps in the history as "YYYY-MM-DD HH" for each command.

Another good practice is to log all sessions. This could be achieved with bash internals, but other easy-to-use software can achieve the same, like script, a UNIX tool present in several Linux distributions, or similar tools like ttyrec.

Finally, we should always save the output of any command we execute to a file if possible. While this may not be the case in the next examples, this is to provide a more analytic approach to them, but it's recommended to do it in a real scenario.

Again, these requirements can be more demanding depending on the legal frameworks and the needs of the investigation.

## Accessing the File System

While the disk and devices used may differ depending on the requirements and the environment, the process is similar for all disks physically or virtually attached to the Linux OS. Once we have our preparation setup and logging our steps, let's execute the df command to see the attached devices on the target machine.

Example Terminal
```bash
user@tryhackme$ df
Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root       40581564 7776284  32788896  20% /

```
Drives are attached as devices under the /dev directory. In the output above, the current disk used by the OS is listed under /dev/root. Our device is not mounted yet, and since it is a Virtual Disk attached to a loop interface, it will not appear using the command df. This is also common for physical disks when not directly attached.

We can still list block devices using the lsblk command with the -a option to list all devices, as shown below.

Example Terminal
```bash
user@tryhackme$ lsblk -a
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0     7:0    0  25.2M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/7993
loop1     7:1    0  26.3M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/9881
loop2     7:2    0 104.2M  1 loop /snap/core/17200
loop3     7:3    0 105.4M  1 loop /snap/core/16574
loop4     7:4    0  55.7M  1 loop /snap/core18/2829
loop5     7:5    0  55.4M  1 loop /snap/core18/2846
loop6     7:6    0    64M  1 loop /snap/core20/2318
loop7     7:7    0  63.8M  1 loop /snap/core20/2496
loop8     7:8    0  73.9M  1 loop /snap/core22/1748
loop9     7:9    0  67.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/22526
loop10    7:10   0  91.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24061
loop11    7:11   0   1.1G  0 loop 
loop12    7:12   0         0 loop 
xvda    202:0    0    40G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0    40G  0 part /
xvdh    202:112  0     1G  0 disk
```
Above, we can observe the loop11 interface initialized with 1.1 GB, which matches our Disk Size. This should also be noticed since we need to know that we have enough space to create the images either on the disk we will copy it or on the disk where we will save the image. In our case, is the xvda block, which corresponds to the /dev/root/. The partition is 40 GB in size. 
Note: The upcoming terminal outputs and the ones shown above may sometimes differ from the outputs of the attached VM. This is because the loop devices might change. It is advised to follow the practical commands by identifying the loop device with a 1.1 GB size, which in our case is loop11.

We can get more info about the device using the losetup command with the -l option to list the device and the assigned interface path, in this case /dev/loop11. 

Forensic
Imaging
user@tryhackme$ sudo losetup -l /dev/loop11
NAME        SIZELIMIT OFFSET AUTOCLEAR RO BACK-FILE                 DIO LOG-SEC
/dev/loop11         0      0         0  0 /home/ubuntu/example1.img   0     512
It is possible to acquire further information like the UUID of the image using the blkid with the interface as an argument, as demonstrated in the following example.

Forensic Imaging
```bash
user@tryhackme$ sudo blkid /dev/loop11
/dev/loop11: UUID="1895de04-f9ee-4b8b-b49d-9ef55770073c" TYPE="ext4"
```
With the information above logged into our notes, we should proceed to create the disk's image. Note that if we were using a physical disk, we could also use commands like hparn to get information about the manufacturer, serial number, and other required data.
## Task Section

	lsblk
```

**Question:** Which bash command displays all commands executed in a session?

**Correct Answer**: 
```bash
	history
```

## Task 3: Creating a Forensic Image
Now that we have identified the device, we want to create an image. Let's go ahead and copy this disk to a raw image file for further inspection. This could also be done to another disk if needed, which is a common practice, but in this case, we will do it to a local file in our system with the .img extension to identify the file as an image.

As we recall from our previous task, there is a great variety of tools we can use to create images. We will use dc3dd in this example, an enhanced version of the UNIX command dd. Below, you can find a list of some common tools used to create images.



**dd** - A standard Unix utility for copying and converting files, often used for creating raw disk images

**dc3dd** - An enhanced version of dd with additional features for forensic imaging, including hashing and logging.

**ddrescue** -A data recovery tool that efficiently copies data from damaged drives, attempting to rescue as much data as possible.

**FTK Imager** - A GUI-based tool for creating forensic images, widely used for its ease of use and comprehensive features.


**Guymager** - A GUI-based forensic imaging tool that supports various image formats and provides detailed logs.

**EWF tools (ewfacquire)** - Tools for creating and handling Expert Witness Format (EWF) images, often used in digital forensics.
 
## Imaging

## Running the `dc3dd` Command

To start, let's execute the `dc3dd` command with the following parameters:

- **`if` (input file):** Indicates the device we want to copy; in this case, `/dev/loop11`.
- **`of` (output file):** Specifies where we want to write the disk bytes; here, a file named `example1.img`.
- **`log` (log file):** Saves all the output into a file. In our example: `imaging_loop11.txt`.

---

### Example Command
```bash
dc3dd if=/dev/loop11 of=example1.img log=imaging_loop11.txt
```

Forensic Imaging
```bash
user@tryhackme$ sudo dc3dd if=/dev/loop11 of=example1.img log=imaging_loop11.txt

dc3dd 7.2.646 started at 2024-06-28 22:58:59 +0000
compiled options:
command line: dc3dd if=/dev/loop11 of=example1.img log=imaging_loop11.txt
device size: 2252800 sectors (probed),    1,153,433,600 bytes
sector size: 512 bytes (probed)
  1153433600 bytes ( 1.1 G ) copied ( 100% ),   13 s, 84 M/s                  

input results for device `/dev/loop11':
   2252800 sectors in
   0 bad sectors replaced by zeros

output results for file `example1.img':
   2252800 sectors out

dc3dd completed at 2024-06-28 22:59:12 +0000

```
From the output above, we can confirm that the operation seemed to be successful and that we created a file of the same size, as shown below.

Forensic Imaging
```bash
user@tryhackme$ ls -alh example1.img 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.1G Jun 28 22:28 example1.img
```
Now, let's check what other activities we can perform in the next rooms after the imaging process is over.

**Question:** Click to complete the task.

**Correct Answer**: No answer needed

## Task 4: Integrity Check
Integrity checking in digital forensics imaging is crucial for ensuring that the forensic copy of data is identical to the original. This process uses cryptographic hash functions, such as MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256, to generate unique hash values for both the original and the copied data. By comparing these hash values, investigators can confirm that the evidence was not altered during the imaging process, maintaining its reliability and admissibility in legal proceedings.

Methods for integrity checking include using tools that automatically calculate and verify hashes during the imaging process. Tools like dc3dd  generate and compare hash values in real-time, providing an added layer of assurance. Regular integrity checks throughout the investigation ensure that data remains unchanged, preserving the chain of custody.

Let's again list the block devices on our system using the command lsblk with -l to list the devices.

Example Terminal:
```bash
	user@tryhackme$ sudo lsblk -l
	loop0    7:0    0  25.2M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/7993
	loop1    7:1    0  26.3M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/9881
	loop2    7:2    0 104.2M  1 loop /snap/core/17200
	loop3    7:3    0 105.4M  1 loop /snap/core/16574
	loop4    7:4    0  55.4M  1 loop /snap/core18/2846
	loop5    7:5    0  55.7M  1 loop /snap/core18/2829
	loop6    7:6    0    64M  1 loop /snap/core20/2318
	loop7    7:7    0  63.8M  1 loop /snap/core20/2496
	loop8    7:8    0  73.9M  1 loop /snap/core22/1748
	loop9    7:9    0  67.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/22526
	loop10   7:10   0  91.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24061
	loop11   7:11   0   1.1G  0 loop 
	xvda   202:0    0    40G  0 disk 
	xvda1  202:1    0    40G  0 part /
	xvdh   202:112  0     1G  0 disk 

```
We can observe that the device is still listed in /dev/loop11. Let's ensure our imaging process was successful. To do that, let's calculate the MD5 hash of the image we created, example1.img, and let's do the same for the device/dev/loop11. The results should match.
Example Terminal
```bash
user@tryhackme$ sudo md5sum example1.img 
483ca14c7524b8667974a922662b87e8  example1.img

user@tryhackme$ sudo md5sum /dev/loop11
483ca14c7524b8667974a922662b87e8  /dev/loop11
```
As shown above, the calculated hash indeed matches, passing the integrity check for this image we created. Thus, we can confirm that the imaging process has been successful through hashing.

## Task Section
Answer the questions below
**Question:** What is the MD5 hash of the image "exercise.img" located in /home/analyst/? 

**Correct Answer**: 
```bash
	MD5: 1f1da616156f73083521478c334841bb
```

## **Task 5 — Mounting and Verifying Images**

It is worth noting that other types of imaging procedures can be performed, not only on disk devices. These can include:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Remote Imaging** | Involves creating an image over the network, allowing it to acquire data without physical access to the device. |
| **USB Images** | Creates an image of a USB drive's contents. |
| **Docker Images** | While not strictly an image, it creates a snapshot of a Docker container's filesystem and configuration. |

Once we have an image, we can also verify that the image is functional and can be inspected. To do that, we can **mount the image** to confirm the imaging process completed correctly.  
Let’s go ahead and mount the image we created earlier, `example1.img`.

---

### 🧮 **Check Mounted Devices**

As observed before, our disk assigned to the loop interface `loop11` is not mounted.  
Use the `df` command to verify:

```bash
user@tryhackme$ df -h

tmpfs             200760       4    200756   1% /run/user/1001
```
Mounting the Image
```bash
#Create a mount point directory:
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/example1
Mount the image using the loop option:
sudo mount -o loop example1.img /mnt/example1
#Verify by exploring the mounted directory:

ls /mnt/example1/
```

Output:
```bash
	dir01  dir03  dir05  dir07  dir09  dir11  dir13  dir15  dir17  dir19  dir21  dir23  dir25
	dir02  dir04  dir06  dir08  dir10  dir12  dir14  dir16  dir18  dir20  dir22  dir24  lost+found
```

Great! We can list all directories on the mounted directory /mnt/example1, confirming that the image was successfully mounted and accessible.

##Conclusion
